# page-scraping

Please use `npm run start` to run.
Due to time limits I had to skip any diagrams, unit testing, some refatoring to support more seperation of concenns (like moving all consts to another file), unit testing :disappointed:, some refactoring (no nested fors or for/if).
I  tried not to over architecture as this is a simple program but this could be broken further down.
AirBnB does not play nice and it randomly changes class names and structures as seen in the screenshots. I haven't covered all cases just one to make sure page loads before start data scraping.
